**Overview on code**
fight.cpp is a part of task 8 of MIA training 
this is the first time for me to write a code with OOP and it is a very very good experance 
**more details in code**
code  is smulates a battle between two robots (Optimus prime, Megatron) ,each robote has his own heaith and weapons .
for the weapons each weapon has his damage and accuracy .
selsction of weapons is randome .
when the health for any  robote become zero the game will end and anther robot will win
**what i learn from this experance**
i learn more about c++ language this is not the first time i have dealt with c++ but as a python user there are a lot of difference 
i learn more about new library  #include <cstdlib>  // for rand() and  #include <ctime>    // for time() and it is essential to include the to libraries together 
---srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0)));  this line is very important to make the randome numbers different every time 
on anther hand i follow some steps to write the code and it make the task more easy one
-first i read the task more than one time then i start to divide the task into steps (like the main one , the more than one weapon for each robot and choose randomly(i searched for this feature),....)
-arrang the code in form of commints to know what i want to write
-start to write the code .
